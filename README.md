# CAM metabolic proton homeostasis - scripts
This respository contains data and scripts used to study proton metabolism in mature CAM leaves
# Dependencies
libsbml version 5.12.1<br>
cobrapy version 0.5.4<br>
# Instructions
1. Install python version 2, libsbml and cobrapy<br>
2. Go to folder containing scripts<br>
3. Open a console (mac), terminal (linux) or command prompt (windows)<br>
4. Run scripts<br>
# Index
  * Model_Construction: generate 12-phase model from PlantCoreMetabolism model, integrate 4 CAM phases of gas exchange, add metabolite accumulation constraints<br>
  
  * ME_refinement_and_simulations: refine the model for a malic enzyme CAM leaf and run simulations<br>  

     
  * Sensitivity_analysis: Vc/Vo, maintenance cost, PEPCK, FVA<br>
